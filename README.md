Keep in mind, while using the repository to run on your local machine, firsly create a local environment to avoid any clashes.

HOW TO MAKE A LOCAL EVNIRONEMNT:
first install virtualenv:

  pip install virtualenv

then make a local environemnt:

  virtualenv venv
  
Then, to enter that local environemnt:
  use .\env\Scripts\activate.ps1
  
Now, as you are inside your virtual environemnt, install here all the dependencies
And then to make the app to run along with its interactive UI that I made using streamlit
Do
  streamlit run app.py
